# Ignition Challenge

## Introduction
The current website is very static, basic and not very responsive. Your task is to turn it into something that can be extended and re-used in a much larger codebase. 
At Ignition, we build e-learning courses that require many different components, sometimes all on the same page. It is important to organise the code well so it is easy to maintain and update.
Ideally, the finished website should contain the following:

## What we would like to see
**General**
- The gallery should be three columns wide.
- Make sure alignment is consistent and elements are crisp (pixel perfect).
- The two read more buttons currently don't work properly; fix them and make the additional text animate in.
- Code should be legible and suitable as a medium/large-scale project.
**Design**
- Fix whatever you think needs fixing and use your design skills to make it look better.
**JavaScript**
- Write a lightbox/popup to show the full size of the thumbnails on click. The full-sized images are already included (/images/gallery folder).

## Bonus points
- Make the site responsive, while retaining all content.
- At Ignition, we use the React library to build our frontends. We have added a div (and the necessary React scripts) for you to add your own component. It can be anything you like but will ideally change state in some way e.g. button click changes some text 
## Finally
You can be as creative as you like, but please spend no more than 3 hours on this. Be honest with any comments you might have. Thank you for taking the time to take this challenge. Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ask, it is encouraged!
